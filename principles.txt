### SOLID

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

- Make one classe corresponding to each actor.
- The name Single Responsibility Principle may give you the impression that one
module should do just one thing. Well, that's true, but this is a Clean Code
principle, this is not SRP.
- The module should have only one reason to change, that means, one user or
stakeholder. User, stakeholders are also known as actors of the system.
