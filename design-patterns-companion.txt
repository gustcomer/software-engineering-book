### Strategy

- defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them 
interchangeable (via composition)
- also known as Policy Pattern
- it's one strategy to implements Open Closed Principle
- it's one of many ways to implement Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- Decorators let you change the skin of an object while strategy let you change
the guts
- you can change behavior at runtime
- HAS-A is better than IS-A (favor composition over inheritance)
