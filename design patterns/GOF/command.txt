INTENT
Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

ALSO KNOWN AS
Action Pattern, Transaction Pattern

PARTICIPANTS
Client, Command, ConcreteCommand, Receiver, Invoker

CLASSIFICATION
It is Behavioral because it deals mainly with communication between objects.
It combines objects like Command, Receiver and Invoker to cooperate and perform tasks that could not be carried out alone like queueing commands, undo, etc.

IMPLEMENTATION
The Client instantiates a Receiver, an Invoker and some ConcreteCommands.
The Client create some ConcreteCommands injecting the Receiver with const myCommand = new ConcreteCommand(someReceiver, ...someArgs)
When the Client wants to execute the ConcreteCommand, it calls invoker.executeCommand(someConcreteCommand) which do some stuff then calls someConcreteCommand.execute() and pushes the command to some array.
The ConcreteCommand then execute the necessary operation, calling methods in the Receiver when necessary and undo()'ing it also when necessary.
If the Client needs to undo something, call someInvoker.undoLastCommand() for instance.

INSIGHTS
  - you can queue, undo, log commands.

COLLABORATIONS
  - Replace Conditional Dispatcher with Command

USE CASES
  - handle Bank Accounts with deposit and withdrawal commands.

QUALITIES
  - the action and the target object are encapsulated in the Command.
  - decouples the Invoker from the Receiver.
  - the encapsulated requests can be reused in different parts of the application.

GLOSSARY

Client
Command [Action]: object that encapsulates all the information needed to perform an action or trigger an event.
  - it's an interface with execute() and usually undo()
  - usually the Receiver is injected into the Command via constructor.
  - then the Command process the request calling some methods in the Receiver with the correct parameters.
Command: it's an Intention to Act, and you can tell it to fuck it off.
  - an Event, by contrast, is a notification or a signal that something has happened.
ConcreteCommand
Invoker [Caller, Manager, Scheduler, Queue, Dispatcher]: the Client asks the Invoker to execute some command.
  - keeps an array of the commands.
  - has an undo method like undoLastCommand() that calls command.undo()
  - invoker.executeCommand(myCommand).
Receiver [Target]: executes the action
Request: demand to perform a certain action or operation within a software system with the encapsulation of all the information needed including necessary parameters and the target object (receiver).
  - it decouples the Invoker from the Receiver because only the Command knows the Receiver because it is injected dynamically into the Command via constructor in the Client code.
