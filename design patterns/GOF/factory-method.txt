INTENT
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

ALSO KNOWN AS
Virtual Constructor

PARTICIPANTS
Creator, ConcreteCreator, Product, ConcreteProduct

CLASSIFICATION

IMPLEMENTATION
We decide what kind of Product we want and ask the Client code to instantiate this kind of ConcreteCreator.
The ConcreteCreator implements the Creator interface, so it knows how to create ConcreteProducts that do the stuff specified in the Product interface.
After we tell the Client code what we want, instead of a big conditional statement deciding what to do, the decisions are made via polymorphism of the Creator and ConcreteCreator.
The ConcreteProduct is returned and can be used by the Client code.
If we want another kind of Product, we instantiate another type of Creator.
Since the ConcreteProducts implement the same Product interface, the Client code can use it interchangeably.

INSIGHTS
- it deals with the problem of creating objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

GLOSSARY

ConcreteCreator: implements the Creator interface and the factory method to return an instance of a Concrete Product.
ConcreteProduct: different implementations of the product interface.
Creator [Factory]: abstract class that declares the factory method, which returns an object of type Product.
Product: defines the interface of objects the factory method creates.
