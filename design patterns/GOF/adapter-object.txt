INTENT
Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldnâ€™t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

ALSO KNOWN AS
Wrapper

PARTICIPANTS
Client, Target, Adaptee, Adapter

CLASSIFICATION
It's a Structure Pattern because classes and Objects combine to form something that looks like the same class but with different interface.
It has Class scope since it deals only with Classes and interfaces.

IMPLEMENTATION
The Client is used to the Target interface and wants to conform to the Adaptee interface.
It then creates an Adapter that implements the Target interface and contains an Adaptee.
Then the Adapter defines the method of the Target interface, but making a call to the Adaptee method defined in its interface.
The Client instantiates the Adapter and calls the method in its interface as if it was calling the Adaptee method.

INSIGHTS
- the only difference to adapter-class is that the Adapter composes the Adaptee, instead of implementing its interface or inheriting the superclass.

COLLABORATIONS

USE CASES

QUALITIES
- possible to change the behavior of the adapter during runtime by attaching it to different adaptees.
