INTENT
Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite
lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

PARTICIPANTS
Client, Component, Composite, Leaf

THE PATTERN
Each element in the tree structure is either a Leaf or a Composite. But both of
these elements implement the same Composite interface. The interface have tree
related methods such as add(Component), remove(Component) and getChild(int) or
getChildren(Component[]).

INSIGHTS

- To be a Composite candidate, usually the problem will have
  > a tree structure.
  > a Leaf with some property that could make sense and be calculated to 
  Composites.
  > a Composite node performs calculations similar to those of a Leaf node;
  however, it iterates through its children to carry out these operations.
- Composite Pattern is not only about some Tree Data Structure. It's about
being able to treat Composites as a single node and perform calculations on it
the same way you would perform it on a Leaf.

USE CASES

Financial Portfolio Hierarchy: Financial application designed to manage 
investments. In this case, investments could be individual stocks, bonds, or
composite entities like mutual funds, ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds), or entire
portfolios containing multiple types of investments. We need to treat all these
entities uniformly, enabling operations like calculating the total value,
assessing risk, or generating reports to be performed on both individual
investments and groups of investments alike.

Computer Aided Design: geometric shapes can be composed into more complex
structures.

GLOSSARY

add(Component)
Client
Component: Interface for all objects in the composition, may implement default behavior or declare behavioral methods.
Composite: An object that has children. It stores component and implements component methods including child-related operations.
getChild(int)
getChildren(Component[])
Leaf: Represents leaf objects in the composition; has no children.
remove(Component)
