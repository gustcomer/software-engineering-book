INTENT
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them
interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients
that use it.

THE PATTERN


================================================================================
GLOSSARY

Algorithm: sequence of steps or a set of rules designed to solve a specific problem or accomplish a task.
  - "Algorithm" suggests a broader concept than methods or functions that can be implemented in various ways, allowing for greater flexibility and interchangeability of the strategies used.
  - when you have many different ways to perform a task, you can call it an Algorithm.
  - objects that represent a process or algorithm don't occur in nature.
Client: even though not specified directly in this pattern, may call the strategy in some Context, not necessarily a class with this name.
Context: place of the code where you dynamically set the behavior by changing the actual strategy.
  - the context represents some situation in which the Client may find himself.
