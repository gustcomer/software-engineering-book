INTENT
Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.

PARTICIPANTS
Singleton

BEHAVIOR

CLASSIFICATION

IMPLEMENTATION
The Singleton must have a private constructor. That way you can only instantiate the Singleton via the static method.
The Singleton holds a single instance of the Singleton object and you access this object via the getInstance() static method.
The getInstance() creates the instance if it doesn't exist, and returns the existing one if it already exists.
After getting your hands on a Singleton object, you can call methods to perform some business logic.

INSIGHTS
- the Singleton class breaks SRP because it has two responsibilities: take care that only one instance is instantiated and handle some business logic.
- if you compare any two singletons with the === operator, you'll get that they are the same Object.
