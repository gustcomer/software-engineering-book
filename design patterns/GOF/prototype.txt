INTENT
Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.

PARTICIPANTS
Client, Prototype, ConcretePrototypeX

BEHAVIOR

CLASSIFICATION

IMPLEMENTATION
The Prototype interface defines only one method clone() that should be implemented by all objects that want to be clonable.
The Client code can instantiate a ConcretePrototype with the new keyword, but it has the option to clone an existing one.
To clone an existing object, just call the clone() method on it.
A new ConcretePrototype will be returned with fields identical to the actual state of the generating ConcretePrototype.
Each ConcretePrototype will have its own data, and changing the fields of one doesn't affect the fields of the other.

INSIGHTS
- prototype is a way to generate new objects cloning existing ones.
- it should be the basis of Object Oriented Programming instead of Class Oriented Programming.

COLLABORATIONS

USE CASES
Financial Instruments Modeling: make copy of instruments with just slight variations.
Risk Assessment Models: running multiple simulations with slightly varied parameters.

QUALITIES
- can be useful to avoid complex initialization.
- can be useful instantiating things dynamically.
- can do amazing things instantiating things not yet defined, with reflexive programming, etc.
- very useful when we want to use a complex object with just slight difference from a former one.

GLOSSARY

Client: selects which prototype to use and clones it to create new objects.
ConcretePrototypeX: clonable objects that should implement the Prototype interface.
Prototype: interface that only defines one method clone() that should be implemented by all objects that want to be clonable.
