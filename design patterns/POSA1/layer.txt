INSIGHTS

COLLABORATIONS

USE CASES
- Networking Protocols
- Enterprise Applications: Layered architecture is widely used in enterprise applications where business rules change frequently and require a clear separation from the UI.

QUALITIES
- Layer Isolation: Each layer in the architecture serves a specific purpose and operates independently of the other layers. This separation of concerns ensures that changes in one layer have minimal impact on others.
- Each layer communicates with adjacent layers through well-defined interfaces.

GLOSSARY

Enterprise Applications: have well defined business rules that require separation from the rest of the application.
