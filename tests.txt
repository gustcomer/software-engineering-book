### Arrange-Act-Assert

The AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) test pattern states that you can divide your test
in three stages:

1. Setup the environment you're going to test.
2. Perform actions your software would usually do and you're willing to test.
3. Make sure the results obtained and states of the variables are correct.
