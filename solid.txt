### Single Responsibility Principle

- It's preferable to create one Class corresponding to each actor.
- The name Single Responsibility Principle may give the impression that a module
should do one and only one thing. This is a valid Clean Code and refactor
principle, but this is not SRP.
- A module should have one, and only one, reason to change. A module should be
responsible to one, and only one, user or stakeholder. A module should be
responsible to one, and only one, actor.
