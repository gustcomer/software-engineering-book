Assertions

- The three pillars of DDD are Strategic Design, Tactical Design and a Ubiquitous Language.
- Strategic Design relates not only to the Problem Space, but parts of the Solution space too.
- Strategic Design's objective is to define the Bounded Contexts, the Ubiquitous Language and the Context Maps.
- Each Bounded Context has a Ubiquitous Language.
- Each Ubiquitous Language describes a Model. And Language is Model.
- A Domain has many Subdomains
- A Domain Model has many Bounded Contexts.
- A Bounded Context can be represented by a software System.
- The Bounded Context is part of the Solution Space.
- The Domain Model has Bounded Contexts
- There is one Ubiquitous Language per Bounded Context
- There is one Model per Bounded Context, and hence one Uniquitous Language

Questions

================================================================================
Glossary

Bounded Context: part of the software where particular definitions, rules and terms apply consistently.
Context: set of conditions that, if satisfied, make the Model be logically consistent, without contradictory or overlapping definitions.
Core Domain: parts of the model distinctive and central to the purposes of the intended application.
DDD: software development approach centered around the domain and the modeling according to input from that domain's experts.
Domain: sphere of knowledge and activity around the problem which the proposed software is to solve.
Domain Model: an object model of the domain that incorporates both behavior and data.
Entity: object defined primarily by its identity.
Model: simplification of reality that abstracts the aspects relevant to solving the problem at hand and ignore extraneous details.
Problem Space: encompasses the problems a business must solve represented through the Domains and Subdomains.
Solution Space: encompasses the model used to represent the problem and what software to build.
Strategic Design: relates to understanding the Problem Space; where it achieves competitive advantages, the relationships between teams and what software to Build.
Subdomain: specific area within the overall domain.
System: intercommunicating software components that aim to solve a problem or part of it.
Ubiquitous Language: describe the Model inside a Bounded Context with terms and concepts of the business domain, where there should be no ambiguity.
