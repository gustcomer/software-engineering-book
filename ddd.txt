Questions

Glossary

Bounded Context: part of the software where particular definitions, rules and terms apply consistently.
Context: set of conditions that, if satisfied, make the Model be logically consistent, without contradictory or overlapping definitions.
Core Domain: parts of the model distinctive and central to the purposes of the intended application.
DDD: software development approach centered around the domain and the modeling according to input from that domain's experts.
Domain: sphere of knowledge and activity around the problem which the proposed software is to solve.
Domain Model: an object model of the domain that incorporates both behavior and data.
Entity: object defined primarily by its identity.
Model: simplification of reality that abstracts the aspects relevant to solving the problem at hand and ignore extraneous details.
Problem Space: encompasses the problems a business must solve represented through the Domains and Subdomains.
Solution Space: encompasses the model used to represent the problem and what software to build.
Strategic Design: relates to understanding the Problem Space; where it achieves competitive advantages and the relationships between teams.
Subdomain: specific area within the overall domain.
Ubiquitous Language:
